AS A foodie…

I WANT TO create new recipes based off what I have in my fridge
SO THAT I can save money and time
WHEN I enter an ingredient in the search bar
THEN I am presented with an array of choices (recipes) relevant to the search input
WHEN I click on one of them
THEN I am presented with the recipe instructions with all its data (cooking method, ingredients, calories, time, cuisine)
WHEN I click on the Add To Favorite
