## Getting Started

To run Fridge Fren on your local machine, follow these steps:

2. Create an account on [Spoonacular website](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to obtain your `app_id` and `app_key` for accessing their recipe search API.
4. Replace the placeholders for `YOUR_APP_ID`, `YOUR_APP_KEY`, and `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` in the `index.html` file with your actual `app_id`, `app_key`, and `access_key`.

## Usage

Once you have the Fridge Fren website up and running, you can start searching for recipes based on the ingredients you have in your fridge. Simply type in the ingredients you have in the search bar and click on the "Search" button.
